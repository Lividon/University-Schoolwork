            Hiya! My name is Brandon Channer and I am a senior Computer Science major at SUNY University at Buffalo. Some things I enjoy are taking walks, play games with friends, anime, reading novels, and playing with cats. <br>
            Grew up in Brooklyn, New York, and my current goals include Graduating on time, and finding a job (hopefully at google if things work out but I'm just tryna find something).<br>
            But uh, yeah. I'm a pretty simple dude otherwise.
