    <p>
    Hello, my name is Andy Chen. I'm a junior at the University at Buffalo studying Computer Science.
    I am more focused on backend development, but am currently learning more about frontend. 
    I like playing video games, watching anime, and playing sports. 
    I also enjoy taking care of and watching my aquarium at home. 
    Here is my dog, her name is Cocoa.
