        Aloha! My name is Ashley. I am a senior in Computer Science.
        I celebrate my birthday in May. I am a Gemini.
        Things that I love to do are reading, watching tv , cooking and talking.
        My favourite types of books to read are mystery. My favourite genre of movies and shows are Horror and Comedy.
        I love cooking dinner food , I am not a breakfast person. Although it is the most important meal of the day
        I tend to skip it. My favourite genre of music is Dancehall and Hip-Hop.
        I was born and raised in Jamaica , but I live in the city. I will always be an Island Gyal 💛💚🖤❤️‍🔥
